# Hazerdous-NEOs-Prediction-
Identifying Hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) 🚀☄️ This project uses the NASA NEO dataset to predict the potential hazard level of near-Earth objects (NEOs). By applying feature selection techniques (Lasso, Logistic Regression, PSO, Mutual Information Gain, and more) and machine learning models, the study highlights critical features.
