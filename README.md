Identifying Hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) 🚀☄️
This project uses the NASA NEO dataset to predict the potential hazard level of near-Earth objects (NEOs). By applying feature selection techniques (Lasso, Logistic Regression, PSO, Mutual Information Gain, and more) and machine learning models, the study highlights critical features contributing to hazard prediction. The repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation results, offering valuable insights into planetary defense strategies. 🌍🔭
